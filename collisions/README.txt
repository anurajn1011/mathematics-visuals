This project was as an exercise to get a handle on p5.js, for future projects or articles that I would be interested in writing about. I followed the tutorial, 
Elastic collision tutorial by thecodeofnature on Open Processing, to get a feel on the language; that resource can be found at this link https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2327422/.

A natural follow up to such a project would be to model this scenario in a three dimensional level, treating the balls as newtonian particles.
Further, visualizations of 2D/3D inelastic collisions would also be a natural follow up as well as a 2D/3D model of gravitation (Newtonian/GR).
